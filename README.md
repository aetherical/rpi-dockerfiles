# rpi-dockerfiles
Dockerfiles for Raspberry Pi -- these replacement dockerfiles can be used to build various packages.

Each project is in a directory; see the README file in the directory for items such as the URI for the git repository.

In order to create a container, use the run.sh script in this directory, specifying the package you want to build.
